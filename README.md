Cold Email Generator
This project is a Cold Email Generator built using Llama 3.1, Groq API, ChromaDB, and Streamlit. The application generates personalized cold emails by analyzing user input, allowing sales, marketing, or outreach teams to create effective emails quickly.

Features
AI-Powered Email Generation: Uses Llama 3.1 for natural language understanding and generation.
Efficient Database Storage: Leverages ChromaDB for storing and retrieving customer data, previous emails, and templates.
Performance Optimization: Groq API is used to boost inference speed and reduce response time during email generation.
User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit-based frontend allows easy interaction with the model, enabling users to generate and customize cold emails with ease.
Technologies Used
Llama 3.1: A powerful language model used for generating personalized cold email content.
Groq API: API integration to optimize and accelerate model inference for faster email generation.
ChromaDB: A vector database used for storing customer data and embeddings, ensuring personalized and relevant email content.
Streamlit: A lightweight and interactive web framework used to build the frontend interface for the application.
